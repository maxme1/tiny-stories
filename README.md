# Learn a new language with ChatGPT

This is a small serverless Angular app that I use to learn foreign languages

# Usage

[Here](https://maxme1.github.io/tiny-stories/) you can find a working version of the site.

1. Click the gear icon to choose your settings.

2. Click the "refresh" icon to sample a new story.

3. Translate the story

4. Click "Click here". This will copy a special prompt, paste it into your chat with ChatGPT

5. Copy the result and paste it into the "paste here" area

6. Look at the errors you made and fix them (this really helps learning new words)
